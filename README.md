# DataCollectionApplication

This Android application was created for the DRAPA project Active Authentication.
The objective is to chanllege user with a series of tasks and in the duration, behaviour 
data like touch and text input can be collected. 

Most view (class) was extended so that touch and text input data can be collected. Also a 
builtin keybpard is used. 

The application requires login to the school server (which is no longer avaliable
as the project has ended).
