1^Anderson^4^alex.jpg^They have a terrific selection - customizing the burrito exactly the way you want it is not an issue.  The burritos are large and have a tortilla to accommodate it.  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because they charge extra for the queso.
1^Andrews^5^andrew.jpg^To get the most for your money, I would suggest purchasing the nachos supreme rather than a burrito.  You get a little bit more of everything because you they don't need to fit everything in the tortilla.  The selection of hot sauces is also second to none.
1^Beemer^3^dusting.jpg^If you go to burrito, go to Pancheros.  If you want a quesadilla, go to Fighting Burrito.  Fighting Burrito doesn't make the tortilla fresh, and it doesn't have Bob the mixer.
1^Berndt^5^alex_girl.jpg^This is the first burrito I have every had and they definitely set the bar high! ??I loved the atmosphere and will have to go back to see how the rest of there food is!
1^Boeck^5^kristin.jpg^Fighting Burrito is a great restaurant that offers a variety of choices. If you are looking for a great burrito, filled with exactly what you want or nachos, quesadillas, etc. they have it. Their service is friendly and helpful. The first time I went there I wasn't sure what to order and they walked me through the various options and made sure that I got exactly what I wanted and was completely satisfied. You will not regret going to Fighting Burrito.
1^Brick^4^melissa.jpg^The quesadillas here are to die for!  I couldn't believe it was so cheap too.  The vegetable servings are a little smaller than I would like, but the queso is so good it makes up for it.  On top of that, their big cookies are a fantastic way to finish off the meal.
1^Busch^4^nicholas.jpg^Their queso is to die for!  Definitely worth the additional charge on a burrito.
1^Diggs^5^olivia.jpg^If only they had fresh pressed tortillas like Pancheros.  I really hope they add the equipment to do so soon.
1^Duong^4^patrica.jpg^I couldn't believe how lucky I was to move in so close.  It's sorta expensive to go there for 2 meals a day, but definitely worth it.
1^Ehlert^4^peighton.jpg^I always go to Fighting Burrito with my friends after mug night.  Their food always tastes a bit better at 2:30 on a Friday morning.
1^Engle^3^rachel.jpg^If only I didn't gain weight as fast when I ate here all the time.  At least it tastes pretty good.
1^Foley^3^ryun.jpg^The tortillas break on a frequent basis and are often times a bit dry.  Also, queso costs extra
1^Lavigne^4^nicholas_2.jpg^I love the variety of sour cream and salsa.  They really allow for customization of your burrito exactly how you want it.
1^Pena^5^sam.jpg^Not too many places accept Dwolla, though Fighting Burrito is one of the places in Ames to do so.  I always pay with Dwolla because it reduces the fees paid to credit card companies.
1^Ridout^4^simon.jpg^I can't help myself when I come here.  I always end up with double meat, rice, and beans.  It's sooooo good!  Top it off with queso and you won't regret it.
2^Andrews^4^andrew.jpg^If Jimmy John's toasted their subs, it'd be an absolutely amazing experience.  It's only mostly amazing as it is.  I ordered the Italian Nightclub (#9), and it was the best thing I could have asked for at 1 in the morning.
2^Beemer^5^dusting.jpg^They have a great set up and love the character the menu has. ??The bread is great and gives a fresh new way to enjoy a sub. ??Definitely a new favorite!??
2^Berndt^2^alex_girl.jpg^I went here last week, and the bread was super dry.  Also, their freaky fast delivery wasn't freaky fast.  It took 1 hour to get my sandwich to campus.  Not impressed.
2^Boeck^3^kristin.jpg^The bread was fantastic, but I'm not a fan overall.  They do not offer toasted subs (my favorite), and the selection leaves a lot to be desired.  I did like the barbecue chips though - they're great!  Also, the soda was flat and the staff didn't promptly fix the issue.
2^Brick^4^melissa.jpg^The soda is so overpriced here!  I realize they need to make money, but it's ridiculous how much they charge.  Regardless, the food is great, so I can't complain too much.
2^Busch^4^nicholas.jpg^The chips here cannot be beat!  I go to Jimmy John's weekely just to get my fix.  #6 is my favorite.
2^Diggs^3^olivia.jpg^The bread is hard, and it doesn't seem like a good value to me.
2^Duong^5^patrica.jpg^Their weekend hours are perfect for after a trip to the bars.  I can't believe how good the chips are.
2^Ehlert^4^peighton.jpg^Really wish I could customize the sandwiches more, but otherwise it's good.
2^Engle^4^rachel.jpg^The cookies are the best!  Sometimes I walk two extra blocks after class just to get a cookie.
2^Foley^3^ryun.jpg^I really wish I could have a different type of bread.
3^Beemer^4^dusting.jpg^The rice here is the best!  I'd take this over Little Taipei any day of the week.  The prices are very reasonable, and like mosts Asian restaurants in the area, the tax is included in the menu price which is nice.  I ordered the Orange Chicken, and it was the best I've ever had (outside of Chinatown in San Franscisco).
3^Boeck^4^kristin.jpg^I haven't had better eggrolls than what they have here.  I can't resist since I live in Friley.  This is a 2-3 times a week eating venue for my friends and me.  We typically put our laundry in and head across the street just to get some chicken or beef.
3^Ehlert^4^peighton.jpg^Broccoli beef has been my favorite so far.  We go here before the local Astronomy Club meetings as a way to build community and get to know eachother better.  The service is very quick, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is very quiet
3^Engle^5^rachel.jpg^You just can't beat Joy's Mongolian Grill!  I have never had to wait for a table, the food is reasonably priced, and they have all you care to eat rice.  Great for a college student in need of a cheap but filling meal.  Unfortunately they add an additional charge for credit card transactions under $7.00.
3^Engle^2^rachel.jpg^It's not what I expected at all!  I was hoping for something like HuHot, but the food was good regardless.
3^Pena^5^sam.jpg^Sesame Chicken.  Best in town.  Ever since Cocost shut down, this has been my go-to place.
4^Berndt^4^alex_girl.jpg^The location isn't the most up to date, but it's still a cool restraunt.  I wish I lived a bit closer and could just walk over on a weekly basis.  Thankfully they offer free delivery, so it's not a big deal in the scheme of things.
4^Boeck^4^kristin.jpg^I don't recommend Pizza Pit. Their service was horrible. It took forever to get my pizza and by the time I finally got it, it wasn't correct. It wasn't a busy time of day either. It was a great disappointment because all I had heard about the place were great, and it didn't deliver.
4^Brick^4^melissa.jpg^Their pizza and wings are good, they have free delivery which is also nice.  The prices are a bit high though, and there's no way to order online.  If they add online ordering, they'd get 4.5 easy.
4^Lavigne^5^nicholas_2.jpg^I went here with friends on a Friday night.  It was a bit loud with Welch Avenue Station right below, but definitely managable.  The food was great!  Service took about 35 minutes from order to food on the table, and the waitress was really good at making sure we were always in good shape.
4^Pena^4^sam.jpg^We came here as a club with a sponsor to discuss our project.  It wasn't busy at 1 PM, and we were able to bring a few tables together to accommodate us.  The staff was very nice and kept our drinks filled.  It took awhile to get the food, but the ingredients were very flavorful and super delicious.
4^Ridout^5^simon.jpg^The have great pizza! ??I am usually not a fan of thin crust pizza but it is amazing!??
5^Beemer^5^dusting.jpg^The service was fast and the staff was friendly. I was in and out of the restaurant and they gave me exactly what I wanted. Not to mention the cost is very affordable for a college student. I would recommend this Subway for its fast and friendly service.
5^Boeck^3^kristin.jpg^It's annoying they don't have all the footlongs as $5, but their specials are pretty good occasionally.  I always fill out the surveys on the back of the receipt so that I can get a free cookie.  Meatball Maranara was not my favorite.  At least they have toasted subs.  They are so much better than cold subs.
5^Diggs^5^olivia.jpg^A six inch sub was more than enough to fill me up.  The restraunt was clean and there wasn't a long wait.  In and out within 15 minutes, eating included.
5^Lavigne^5^nicholas_2.jpg^Absolutely amazing! ??You can't beat subway! They are fresh and great for something completely different and healthy.
5^Ridout^5^simon.jpg^I have never had anything but fantastic service from Subway.  I've come here every day for 2 years.  After 3 weeks, they knew me by name, had my order memorized, and stopped asking me if I wanted to upgrade to a large pop.  Steve the manger is awesome if you ever stop in.
5^Zenner^4^victoria.jpg^JanyANY is an awesome promotion, I just wish it were the case all the time.  The Oven Roasted Chicken sandwich is my favorite sandwich on the menu.  This location is always clean and the manager is really nice.
6^Berndt^5^alex_girl.jpg^I've been working my way through the entire specialty sandwich menu the last semester.  I made it through 12 sandwiches, and there were only two that weren't absolutely amazing.  The Reuben has been my favorite so far, but the Cowboy Chicken isn't far behind.
6^Brick^5^melissa.jpg^Being an engineer, this place is super tempting every time lunch comes around.  Not only is it cheaper than Clyde's, but the food tastes better, the service is faster, and the flavor is way better.  I wouldn't recommend the Greek, but everything else is out of this world!  No place in Ames has better sandwiches.
6^Busch^5^nicholas.jpg^I can walk from the Nuclear Engineering Lab to West Street Deli and back faster than I can get any food from Clyde's.  For this reason, I am a regular at West Street Deli, they know me by name
6^Diggs^5^olivia.jpg^Our department lunch is done by West Street Deli every month.  We gave them a chance 6 months ago, and everyone loved the awesome sandwiches!  Nowhere else can you get such a tasty meal for so little money.
6^Duong^4^patrica.jpg^Their sandwiches are expensive and small.  I was not filled when I left.  Then again, I'm not satisfied with a footlong sub from Subway either, so maybe sandwiches aren't for me.
6^Ehlert^5^peighton.jpg^If you are looking for a sandwich or wrap that is both fulfilling and cheap, West Street Deli is the place for you! There regular sized sandwich is more than enough for lunch. They have a wide variety of sandwiches to fulfill your every craving. There huge chocolate chip cookies are delicious for dessert. It is a short walk from campus and definitely worth it.??
6^Engle^4^rachel.jpg^The regular is big enough - you don't need a large.  If you have a lot of self control, you could take 1/2 of a large home, but I find that control to be impossible exercise.
6^Foley^4^ryun.jpg^I walk an extra 4 blocks home to pick up a sandwich for dinner.  I have done this onnce a week for 3 semesters now.  I have tried every specialty sandwich, and can tell you the reuben is the best.
6^Lavigne^5^nicholas_2.jpg^I love the french dip.  It's the perfect blend of beef, cheese,  and peppers.  I can't believe I only learned about West Street Deli after my Junior year.  Hindsight is 20/20.
6^Pena^5^sam.jpg^Moving in across the street was the most expensive thing I've ever done.  I love the place so much!  I also love the soup, which I feel too many people overlook.
6^Ridout^5^simon.jpg^Oh my goodness!  This place is the best.  I was in town for a conference and ended up eating here every night for dinner, and it was worth the money every time.
6^Zenner^4^victoria.jpg^Places like this make me wish I lived in Ames rather than Cedar Rapids.  We just don't have good sandwich shops like this.
7^Berndt^4^alex_girl.jpg^I came to Hickory Park with 10 people, and the most popular order was the Chicken and Pork Ribs.  I personally went with the garden burger, but ate the leftovers from 4 people.  My only regret from the awesome night of music, friends, and comradery was not getting teh chicken and pork ribs.  They were fantastic and smothered in their amazing barbecue sauce.
7^Boeck^5^kristin.jpg^The barbecue sampler is the best!  I couldn't believe how tasty all three types of meat were, or how good of a deal it was.  The line was long, but worth the wait.
7^Busch^4^nicholas.jpg^With three different types of sausage, the homemade sausage sandwich is my new go-to dinner.  Coupled with baked beans and their fresh corn, you can't beat this as far as food under $10 goes.
7^Duong^3^patrica.jpg^The barbecue dinner was decent, though not my favorite.  I liked the grilled frank quite a bit more.  It's tough to tell what I like since all four meats are mixed together on one bun.
7^Engle^4^rachel.jpg^The Classic BLT - exactly what you're expecting.  A large sandwich loaded with bacon.  The bacon is made to order and you can request soft/crunchy depending on your personal preference.
7^Engle^4^rachel.jpg^Saucy Southerner is a classic. I love ordering pints to go, freezing it, and heating some up when I don't feel like cooking! Definitely recommend it for large gatherings and parties as well.??
7^Foley^5^ryun.jpg^Everything you can imagine is on the garbage burger, and that's what makes it so awesome.  I waited in line for 45 minutes, but it was such a great burger I didn't even care.
7^Foley^5^ryun.jpg^"Their italian sausage is simply the best. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to try something outside of their ""classic"" items.??"
7^Pena^3^sam.jpg^The homemade sausage sandwich was alright. It wasn't my favorite. I would prefer the smoked ham or turkey over this sandwich.??
7^Ridout^2^simon.jpg^I do not recommend the french onion soup.The onion flavoring was over powering. I was very disappointed because this is one of my favorite types of soup.??
8^Boeck^5^kristin.jpg^Pro-tip: switch out the chips for texas toast.  Way more filling, better tasting, and all around a better experience.  The meat here is the best I've found in Ames, even better than Hickory Park
8^Brick^5^melissa.jpg^I cannot believe how awesome the pulled pork sandwiches are!  I normally don't like barbecue restaurants, though this is the one exception I make in Ames.  The flavor is vibrant, the hawt sauce electrifying, and my taste buds be tinglin' all the way home.
8^Busch^5^nicholas.jpg^The sauces at Battle's are awesome.  I end up buying a couple bottles every year so I can make my barbecue taste just as good.
8^Duong^4^patrica.jpg^The turkey sandwich was a bit dry, but the flavor was still decent.  I did really like the bread though.  Not dry and still flavor filled.
8^Ehlert^4^peighton.jpg^Burnt ends are a great deal, though they're only available every now and then.  If this were a regular menu item, I would stop by at least once a week.
8^Engle^3^rachel.jpg^Their beef sandwich was run-of-the-mill.  Tasty, but nothing that special.
8^Foley^5^ryun.jpg^BBQ Ham is a combination I hadn't tried until 2 weeks ago.  It was surprising how moist the ham was - not dry at all despite being smoked.  I would definitely try this again.
8^Pena^5^sam.jpg^Mixed meat is the way to go.  Chicken and a half-rack of pork ribs is the most satisfying meal on Welch.  Don't forget to ask for Texas Toast and extra sauce to make the meal complete!
9^Anderson^4^alex.jpg^A great afternoon pick-me-up are the baked apple pies from McDonald's.  They're kinda like the dutch apple pies from Little Debbie, but hot.
9^Andrews^5^andrew.jpg^If I could purchase the Big Mac sauce, I would buy a gallon in a heartbeat - ironically this might just lead directly to my last heartbeat!  I love the Big Macs, and typically have one for lunch and one for dinner.  It may be expensive, but it's worth it.
9^Beemer^4^dusting.jpg^Nothing beats a McFlurry on a hot summer day!  They're so thick and tasty I can't resist.  If only they were free of calories and unhealthiness.
9^Berndt^5^alex_girl.jpg^Their fries are the bomb!  Unfortunately they don't put black pepper out anymore, but black pepper+ketchup+McDonald's Fries makes any day look a bit better.
9^Brick^5^melissa.jpg^Only coming around when the beef prices are low, but that?€?s alright.  I've found freezing them for up to 6 months to be an effective way to ensure I have a supply throughout the year.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants something new for a change.
9^Brick^4^melissa.jpg^The hash brown portions are small and unsatisfying.  They taste good, but simply aren't worth what they charge.
9^Duong^4^patrica.jpg^Everyone should try the McRib sandwich before they die.  It's something else!  I love it so much, I started a website to crowdsource tracking which locations still have them available.  Check it out!  http://mcriblocator.com/
9^Ehlert^4^peighton.jpg^Everything needed for a complete meal, all in one sandwich!  I am not one for mixing foods like this normally, but it's just SO good, I can't help myself.
9^Foley^5^ryun.jpg^The Tuesday special is 59 cent hamburgers, 69 cent cheeseburgers.  It's basically the cheapest dinner in town.  I'm full for under $2 and drink my own water to save a bit more money.
9^Lavigne^2^nicholas_2.jpg^The cheese is so artificial it's not even funny.  I never order cheeseburgers because it's so nasty!
9^Pena^5^sam.jpg^In high school, we used to go to McDonald's after every football game.  Somehow they managed to take orders and feed 50 of us in under 20 minutes.  Super efficient, and it tasted amazing since we were so hungry.  I still come by about once a week to get my fix on fries and greasy food.
9^Ridout^5^simon.jpg^I can't go a day without an Egg McMuffin to get me going for the day.  It's the perfect breakfast, combining meat, cheese, egg, and bread into each awesome bite.  They're a little small, so I order two, but I still consider them to be a very good value.
10^Anderson^3^alex.jpg^I can't believe they get away charging as much as they do for pizza.  Unless you get the daily special, figure ~2 times what you would pay at Papa John's.
10^Andrews^4^andrew.jpg^The excessive taste is overwhelming.  My friends and I wander over to Jeff's on Friday nights and are never disappointed.
10^Boeck^3^kristin.jpg^??I do not recommend the BBQ chicken pizza. BBQ flavoring should not be added to pizza. There are so many better options available. If nothing else, order cheese pizza before you order the BBQ chicken.
10^Brick^5^melissa.jpg^Their breadsticks are amazing! One of the best items on the menu.
10^Busch^4^nicholas.jpg^Nowhere else can you eat buffalo on a pizza - not even Great Plains Pizza.  Jeff's may be a bit more expensive than the typical college kid food, but you get what you pay for in variety of ingredients and flavor.
10^Duong^4^patrica.jpg^Even a 1-topping from Jeff's is amazing.  All the meat seems so fresh and the cheese is super high quality.
10^Engle^4^rachel.jpg^I haven't gone a day without smotharella sticks in over 3 weeks.  I wish I could buy them at Hy-Vee, but I know they probably wouldn't be as good as the original.
10^Foley^5^ryun.jpg^Who needs pizza when smotharella sticks exist?  They're quite possibly the best thing to come to Ames since Iowa State University itself.  If you have never been to town, definitel check Jeff's out for great pizza, dessert, and the ever famous smotharella sticks.
10^Foley^3^ryun.jpg^Jeff's just isn't my style.  Maybe it's the atmosphere, or the weird pizza toppings, I'm not sure.  The pizza is decent, but it's got nothing on Great Plains Pizza.
10^Pena^5^sam.jpg^Whenever we order food as a club, we make sure to order 1 large BBQ Bacon Chicken Ranch, though it's typically at least 3/4 of the pizzas we order.  The flavor just can't be beat!
10^Ridout^5^simon.jpg^They make a killer taco pizza!  Thicker than most, Jeff's mixes the recipe up in only the best ways possible.
11^Anderson^4^alex.jpg^I really like their burger of the month specials.  The burger of the month is typically better than anything else they offer, and if you don't like it, you only have to put up with it for another 4 weeks.
11^Andrews^2^andrew.jpg^Many days have been lost to students at Clyde's waiting for food that got lost in the ordering process, somebody else took, or waiting to see number 71 show up on the screens.  If only the price of the food went down as the wait went up - then it might be worth the wait.
11^Beemer^2^dusting.jpg^I have never seen this place operate effectively.  My fries sit out for 10 minutes while my burger gets cooked.  I get cold fries and a burger which leaves a lot to be desired.  Oh, and it's expensive.  Would not recommend.
11^Boeck^2^kristin.jpg^All I ordered was onion rings and 2 pieces of pizza.  Somehow this was $8.  For the same money I can get a huge plate of chinese food just 2 blocks away, 3 entrees at Panda Express, or a large sandwich at West Street Deli.  If you don't have meal bundles, don't go to Clydes's.
11^Busch^1^nicholas.jpg^I went here 3 times Fall semester, and every time I was sick within 24 hours.  I'm not saying they prepared my food in an unsafe manner, but the circumstances don't point to anything else as the cause of my issues.
11^Duong^2^patrica.jpg^"It doesn't matter what time you go, it will be at least 15 minutes before you get your food.  Even if the pizza is sitting there, ready to go, and you're the only one there, you will wait 15 minutes before your order is ready.  I'm not sure how they manage to be so incredibly inefficient, but it's certainly impressive.  As an industrial engineer, I see lots of ""opportunity"" every time I visit."
11^Ehlert^1^peighton.jpg^If every restraunt was run like Clyde's, they would have been out of business years ago.  Way over priced food with nothing special about it, an incredible wait, and the food isn't even good.  The only food which is consistently decent is the Godfather's Pizza.
11^Engle^2^rachel.jpg^What kind of a sports bar doesn't serve alcohol?  I haven't heard of anyone actually watching a game at Clyde's.  Their management also leaves a lot to be desired, as can be seen with their incredible response times.
11^Pena^3^sam.jpg^I may be a bit tainted because of a local joint where I grew up, but I don't like the onion rings at Clyde's.  It's obvious the onion rings came out of a paper bag and were placed in the fryer.  I'd rather get leftovers from the dumpster behind Subway than to eat the onion rings at Clyde's
11^Ridout^2^simon.jpg^It's cheaper and faster to walk to West Street Deli.  I wish I learned this last semester when I was eating at Clyde's 3 days a week.  West Street Deli has way less of a wait and tastes way better.
11^Zenner^4^victoria.jpg^I pity the fool who doesn't use WebOrder.  The easiest way to get past the excessive wait is to simply order online.  It doesn't make the food taste any better, but at least you aren't waiting in the restaurant.  Also - cell phone reception is atrocious in Clyde's if you're not near the windows.
12^Beemer^5^dusting.jpg^"Whoever was the genius to make the Taco Bravo deserves a raise.  I haven't heard of anywhere else I can get a hard shell taco within a soft shell taco with ""the works"" for $1.49."
12^Busch^4^nicholas.jpg^Take a friend and go get a six-pack and a pound! This is one of the best things about Taco Johns. Who doesn't love tacos and oles?
12^Diggs^3^olivia.jpg^I don't recommend the fish tacos. I would stick to the classic items on the menu such as the taco bravo.  I have never had a good fish taco whether I paid $3 or $8 for them. Stay away from the fish tacos!
12^Engle^3^rachel.jpg^If you are looking for a place to go with your children, take them to Taco Johns. They have a wide variety of foods from tacos to chicken fingers to quesadillas. Every one in the family should be able to find something that they like for an affordable price.
12^Foley^4^ryun.jpg^Thursdays are 1/2 price Taco Bravo after 4:00.  Their taco bravos are amazing. It's the perfect combination of a hard shell and soft shell.
12^Foley^4^ryun.jpg^If you are looking to branch out and try something new, I recommend trying the stuffed grilled taco. It isn't spicy, but the flavoring does have a slight kick to it. It is new to the menu, but definitely one of the better options if you are looking to try something new.??
12^Lavigne^5^nicholas_2.jpg^Soft shells have a tendancy to get dry or soggy, but Taco John's is really good about preventing this from happening.
12^Lavigne^5^nicholas_2.jpg^If you are looking for a traditional taco, go with the soft shell. Couple it with an order of oles or a churro and you're ready to take on the rest of the day!
12^Pena^5^sam.jpg^Their potato oles are amazing! I would consider it one of their staple items.??
13^Anderson^2^alex.jpg^Their egg rolls leave a lot to be desired.  I have never seen them put fresh egg rolls out despite going to Panda every day for lunch.  There's no way what you're eating is anywhere near fresh, and don't you ever let anyone tell you otherwise.
13^Andrews^3^andrew.jpg^The broccoli beef is my favorite! The flavoring of the broccoli mixed with the beef is great. I definitely would recommend it??for someone who is looking for a lighter meal.
13^Andrews^2^andrew.jpg^One of their new items, is honey walnut shrimp. I normally don't eat walnuts, but you can barely taste them. The different blend of flavors comes together to make a really good dish.??
13^Beemer^2^dusting.jpg^I did not like the kung pao chicken. I would not recommend it.??I don't understand why they ruined an otherwise good Chinese dish with peanuts.
13^Berndt^2^alex_girl.jpg^Mushroom Chicken is mostly mushrooms.  If I had to guess, mushrooms are cheaper than chicken per pound.
13^Boeck^2^kristin.jpg^As long as you add sweet and sour sauce, the crab rangoons are decent.  They did make me sick one time though, so I haven't had one since.
13^Brick^4^melissa.jpg^If you are looking for a dish which is entirely underwhelming, order the Beijing Beef. You won't be disappointed.??
13^Busch^4^nicholas.jpg^The brown rice is WAY better than white.  I'm so glad they added it to the menu to start off the new year.
13^Diggs^3^olivia.jpg^If you want a lot of food, go near closing time.  15 minutes before close and you'll have tiny servings.  5 minutes before close and they'll fill your plate as full as they can, ensuring they don't throw any food away.  Good strategy for poor college students.  The flavor is decent, but incredibly Americanized.
13^Foley^3^ryun.jpg^Orange chicken is a classic option on the menu. It isn't too spicy and doesn't include any vegetables. Couple this with any type of rice option and you're set.  I like to pretend this is healthy because I eat it for lunch 3 days a week.
13^Zenner^4^victoria.jpg^The peppercorn shrimp is my new favorite. I would not have thought to mix these flavors together, but they work!??
